This project is meant to help us understand how to make API calls in React. This project calls Youtube's API and displays a video in addition to the top 5 related videos.

To Run this project, clone the repo, run "npm install", followed by "npm start" in the terminal. Then open your web browser to localhost:8888. If the web browser doesn't pull it up, try localhost:8080 (this is the default port for webpack-dev-server). You can also figure-out which port it is by going to the node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js and finding the default port for your version of webpack.
